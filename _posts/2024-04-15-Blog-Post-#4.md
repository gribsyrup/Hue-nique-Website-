# Blog post week 4(4/15): 

### This week was slightly slower, because we did end up putting a lot of our time into shaping the game together so that it would work as best we could for the alpha on wednesday. 

## Tech team: 
The tech team has begun to work on the main aspects of making our game more goal oriented and collect-a-thon like leading up to the playtesting segment.

James: Working on fixing the physics and bugs surrounding the grapple, in order to make the level less easily traversable and progression more smooth. 

Niralya: Began implementing the collection system of gondola parts and adding a proper AI to the golems. 

Khan: Working on implementing UI for the game, starting for the rune system and working from there. Also added a lot of sound effects, such as footsteps

## Art team: 

Lauren: Added a wide variety of animations to the lizard since the alpha, ranging from the tongue grapple to all the movement. 

Juliet: Made textures for a large variety of cave assets. 

Griffin: Finalized the models for the golem enemies. 


Here are some progress screenshots from the art team this week:
